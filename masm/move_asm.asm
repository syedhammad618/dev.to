;Here is a short program that demonstrates the use of MOV instruction:


#MAKE_COM#        ; instruct compiler to make COM file.
ORG 100h          ; directive required for a COM program.
MOV AX, 0B800h    ; set AX to hexadecimal value of B800h.
MOV DS, AX        ; copy value of AX to DS.
MOV CL, 'A'       ; set CL to ASCII code of 'A', it is 41h.
MOV CH, 01011111b ; set CH to binary value.
MOV BX, 15Eh      ; set BX to 15Eh.
MOV [BX], CX      ; copy contents of CX to memory at B800:015E
RET               ; returns to operating system.
